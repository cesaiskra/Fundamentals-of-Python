'''
You can calculate the surface area of a cube if you know the length of an
edge. Write a program that takes the length of an edge (an integer) as
input and prints the cube's surface area as output.
'''

a = input("input the cube's edge length  :")
s = 6 * int(a) ** 2
print "cube's surface is", str(s)
